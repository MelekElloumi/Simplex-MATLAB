# Simplex Method in MATLAB

- This is an implementation of the simplex method to solve Linear Maximisation problems in `MATLAB`.
- It is configured to take multiple variables and constraints.
- import the files in matlab and run `simplex.m`

### Ex√©cution:
- We will run the method on this maximisation problem:
